A Web Site Tester/Hack

We needed something at work to quickly verify that our custom code was still working on our web site whenever there was an update/upgrade.

This allows you to set the root of the web site, a pause (so you can login) then as many pages you would like to open up in a new tab/browser window to verify things are working.

It is currently mostly manual, no http status codes or anything like that.
